# Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

The Disease Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of specific diseases based on input features and historical data. This machine learning project utilizes data analysis, model training, and data visualization to provide accurate disease predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Machine learning model training
- Interactive data visualizations
- Prediction output for diseases

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Anaconda Spyder
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQL
- Machine Learning Models

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajdeep-Sutariya/Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Disease-Prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch Anaconda Spyder:

2. Open the `Disease_Prediction.py` notebook.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to explore the dataset, preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.
